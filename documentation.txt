The REST API uses Node.js, Express and MongoDB as the tech stack.

The installed dependencies are express as the backend framework,
and mongoose as the ORM to interract with the MongoDB database.

Furthermore I also used nodemon and dotenv as dev dependencies.
Nodemon restarts the dev server upon saving changes to the files,
and dotenv allows us to declare environment variables in a .env file,
where we store the database url.

Git was also used for version control, and thereforea .gitignore file is added
to ignore the node_modules folder to avoid unnecessary uploads to GitHub,
and the .env file is ignored for security reasons.

The source code consists of the server.js, routes/vehicle.js, models/vehicle.js files.

In the server.js file, we:
    - set up the express app
    - connect to our database
    - give feedback about the db connection
    - tell express where to look for the routes
    - start listening for requests on port 3000

In the routes/vehicle.js file, we:
    - set up the express router
    - create the API endpoints with the requested business logic
    - export the router

In the models/vehicle.js file, we:
    - create the mongoose vehicle model
    - export the mongoose vehicle model
